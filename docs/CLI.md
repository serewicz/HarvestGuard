# HarvestGuard CLI

HarvestGuard's unified CLI runs local scanners through the normalized finding
model. It does not add storage, dashboard functionality, risk scoring, or
executive reporting.

## Installation

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

For an editable install that exposes the `harvestguard` command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Without installing the console script, run the same CLI as a module:

```bash
python -m harvestguard scan ./target
```

## Usage

```bash
harvestguard scan <path> [--summary] [--json [PATH]] [--markdown [PATH]] [--quiet] [--exclude <pattern>]
```

The `scan` command runs current local scanners:

- local filesystem encryption evidence
- cryptographic asset inventory
- sensitive-data category detection
- local Semgrep crypto code analysis

Cloud scanners remain available through their scanner modules. The first CLI
command intentionally accepts a local path only.

## Examples

Default summary:

```bash
harvestguard scan ./target
```

Example output:

```text
HarvestGuard Scan Complete

Files scanned: 412

Findings

Certificates: 18
Private Keys: 5
Encrypted Keys: 1
SSH Keys: 2
PKCS#12: 1
Expired Certificates: 2
Sensitive Files: 7
Semgrep Findings: 4
Malformed Assets: 1
Errors: 0

Total Findings: 39
```

JSON normalized findings:

```bash
harvestguard scan ./target --json --quiet
```

Write JSON normalized findings to a file:

```bash
harvestguard scan ./target --json findings.json --quiet
```

Markdown report:

```bash
harvestguard scan ./target --markdown --exclude "vendor/*"
```

Write a professional Markdown evidence report:

```bash
harvestguard scan ./target --markdown report.md --exclude "vendor/*"
```

The Markdown report includes:

- Executive Summary
- Scan Information
- Scanner Versions
- Scope
- Findings Summary
- Finding Breakdown by Type
- Detailed Findings
- Errors and Warnings
- Known Limitations
- Appendix

## Exit Codes

- `0`: scan completed without scanner-level failures.
- `1`: at least one scanner failed, but other recoverable scanner results were
  returned.
- `2`: invalid CLI usage, such as a path that does not exist.

## Output Notes

JSON output serializes normalized findings from
[NORMALIZED_FINDINGS.md](NORMALIZED_FINDINGS.md) without changing the schema.
Markdown output is a professional evidence report suitable for attaching to an
issue, email, or advisory note. It reports observed evidence only. It does not
add executive priority, risk scoring, remediation recommendations, ownership,
persistence, or telemetry.
