    -- HG-031's correction cycle 2 established that "looks like armor" is not
    "is complete armor", so every one of these is now enforced, not merely
    the ones a truncated/malformed file happened to trip over before:

      1. the armor header line alone on the first line;
      2. optional ``Key: Value`` armor headers;
      3. the mandatory blank separator line;
      4. a radix-64 encoded packet stream, whole quantums only;
      5. a radix-64 checksum line (``=`` plus exactly four radix-64 octets)
         whose decoded value is the CRC-24 of the decoded packet stream --
         not merely a line that starts with ``=``;
      6. an armor tail line matching the *same* label as the header line,
         exactly, with nothing else on that line.

    mismatched tail line, or content the tail line does not immediately
    follow are all rejected -- this is not armor, and is not read as though
    it were.

    The first decoded byte is therefore the first byte of the first OpenPGP

    to read -- the armored counterpart of offset 0 in a binary file, not a

    armored counterpart of a binary file's bytes: the caller's declared-length
    check is only meaningful against the complete content, since a packet
    declaring more body than the stream actually holds is truncated or
    over-declared either way. Nothing decoded here is reported; the payload is
